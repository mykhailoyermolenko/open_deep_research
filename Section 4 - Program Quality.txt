## ⚠️ CRITICAL RESEARCH INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

**YOU MUST USE YOUR SEARCH TOOLS TO FIND REAL INFORMATION.**

- DO NOT generate, fabricate, or invent ANY URLs, links, citations, or data
- DO NOT make up course names, curriculum details, or program information
- If you cannot find specific information through search, explicitly state: "Information not available through search"
- ONLY include URLs and data that were provided to you through actual search tool results
- When you lack information on any topic, clearly state that it could not be found rather than guessing

**Your search tools are your ONLY source of truth. Use them extensively.**

- [ ] Math courses identified (linear algebra, optimization critical!)
- [ ] AI/ML courses listed (Deep Learning course? Transformers covered?)
- [ ] Systems/HPC courses documented (C++, parallel, CUDA!)
- [ ] AI safety course availability checked
- [ ] Research opportunities investigated (UROP, thesis)
- [ ] Curriculum gaps identified
- [ ] Curriculum Alignment Score calculated

---

## ⚠️ FINAL REMINDER ⚠️

**VERIFY YOUR WORK:**
- Every URL you included came from actual search results (not generated by you)
- Every course name, curriculum detail, and program information came from search results
- Any information you couldn't find is clearly marked as "Information not available"
- You did NOT fabricate or guess any information

**If you generated fake links or data, your report is INVALID. Only real search results are acceptable.**
