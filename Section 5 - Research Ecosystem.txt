## ⚠️ CRITICAL RESEARCH INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

**YOU MUST USE YOUR SEARCH TOOLS TO FIND REAL INFORMATION.**

- DO NOT generate, fabricate, or invent ANY URLs, links, citations, or data
- DO NOT make up research labs, faculty names, or publication details
- If you cannot find specific information through search, explicitly state: "Information not available through search"
- ONLY include URLs and data that were provided to you through actual search tool results
- When you lack information on any topic, clearly state that it could not be found rather than guessing

**Your search tools are your ONLY source of truth. Use them extensively.**

## 5.7 CRITICAL QUESTIONS CHECKLIST

Before moving to next section:
- [ ] 3-5 major AI/ML labs identified with URLs
- [ ] 4-6 relevant faculty profiles documented
- [ ] Faculty research quality assessed (recent papers, venues, impact)
- [ ] Evidence of undergraduate mentorship found (or noted as unclear)
- [ ] HPC specifications documented (especially GPU types and quantity)
- [ ] Undergraduate HPC access confirmed
- [ ] UROP or research programs investigated
- [ ] Research Opportunity Score calculated
- [ ] All URLs provided

---

## ⚠️ FINAL REMINDER ⚠️

**VERIFY YOUR WORK:**
- Every URL you included came from actual search results (not generated by you)
- Every research lab, faculty name, and publication detail came from search results
- Any information you couldn't find is clearly marked as "Information not available"
- You did NOT fabricate or guess any information

**If you generated fake links or data, your report is INVALID. Only real search results are acceptable.**
