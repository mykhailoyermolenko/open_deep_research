## ⚠️ CRITICAL RESEARCH INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

**YOU MUST USE YOUR SEARCH TOOLS TO FIND REAL INFORMATION.**

- DO NOT generate, fabricate, or invent ANY URLs, links, citations, or data
- DO NOT make up course names, program details, or statistics
- If you cannot find specific information through search, explicitly state: "Information not available through search"
- ONLY include URLs and data that were provided to you through actual search tool results
- When you lack information on any topic, clearly state that it could not be found rather than guessing

**Your search tools are your ONLY source of truth. Use them extensively.**

## SECTION 0: PROGRAM IDENTIFICATION
## TARGET UNIVERSITY: [University Name]

---

### OBJECTIVE:
Quickly identify the single best program at this university that matches the student's AI research profile.

---

### STUDENT'S PROFILE REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Technical, research-oriented Bachelor's degree in AI/CS
✓ Heavy emphasis on advanced mathematics (linear algebra, optimization, probability)
✓ Deep learning theory and modern architectures (neural networks, Transformers, LLMs)
✓ Systems programming for high-performance computing (C++, CUDA, parallel computing)
✓ Technical AI safety and alignment (not just ethics)

---

### RESEARCH PROCESS:

**STEP 1: SCAN UNIVERSITY OFFERINGS**

Search the university's official academic catalog:
- Keywords: "Artificial Intelligence," "Machine Learning," "Computer Science," "Data Science," "Robotics," "Computational Intelligence"
- Check: Department of CS, Engineering, Math & Computer Science, School of AI

**Output: List 2-4 Candidate Programs**

For each candidate:
- Official program title (full name)
- Degree awarded (B.S., B.Sc., B.Eng.)
- Department/School
- Direct URL to program page
- Brief 1-sentence description

Example:
1. "B.S. in Artificial Intelligence" - Computer Science Dept - [URL] - Dedicated AI program
2. "B.S. in Computer Science (AI Track)" - CS Dept - [URL] - CS major with AI specialization
3. "B.Sc. in Data Science" - Statistics Dept - [URL] - Data-focused with ML

**STEP 2: QUICK CURRICULUM COMPARISON**

For each candidate, evaluate against profile requirements:

**Comparison Table:**

| Requirement | Candidate A | Candidate B | Candidate C |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Advanced Math** (Linear Algebra, Optimization) | ✓ Strong / ~ Some / ✗ Weak | | |
| **Deep Learning** (Dedicated courses, Transformers) | ✓ / ~ / ✗ | | |
| **Systems/HPC** (C++, CUDA, parallel computing) | ✓ / ~ / ✗ | | |
| **AI Safety** (Technical courses available) | ✓ / ~ / ✗ | | |
| **Research Focus** (Thesis, UROP opportunities) | ✓ / ~ / ✗ | | |

**Evidence:** Cite specific courses from each program's curriculum (with URLs)

**STEP 3: FINAL SELECTION**

**SELECTED PROGRAM:**
- Full Official Name: [X]
- Department: [Y]
- URL: [Z]

**JUSTIFICATION (1 paragraph):**
"This program was selected because [specific reasons tied to profile requirements]. Key strengths include [list 3-4 specific curriculum elements with course names]. It outperforms the alternatives in [specific areas] which are critical for the student's focus on foundational AI research."

### QUALITY CHECK:

Before proceeding to full dossier, verify:
- [ ] Program is undergraduate (Bachelor's) level
- [ ] Program is in CS/AI/ML or closely related field
- [ ] Curriculum has verifiable math/AI/systems courses
- [ ] Program has research component (thesis/capstone)
- [ ] URL provided is to official university page

If any item fails, reconsider program selection or note as limitation.

## ⚠️ FINAL REMINDER ⚠️

**VERIFY YOUR WORK:**
- Every URL you included came from actual search results (not generated by you)
- Every statistic, course name, and detail came from search results
- Any information you couldn't find is clearly marked as "Information not available"
- You did NOT fabricate or guess any information

**If you generated fake links or data, your report is INVALID. Only real search results are acceptable.**
